Contribution in creating things so far:-
Matthew and my self(Tanvi) have set up 2- virtual meetings in this last week and we managed to share our ideas with each other 
and then we have had some discussion regarding which are the users that we should focus mainly on, and after taking into consideration 
multiple factors we come to decision  that Education group and RCE Sask working group as the main user that we want to help mainly.
I(Tanvi) have created the document for problem definition and shared it with Matthew for any changes or modification.
After going into the problem definition, now it is time to create empathy mapping for this users,
we both have discussed the rough "pen and paper" based model via virtually sharing my screen and then Matthew created the Empathy mapping.
